# Diatotab
Diatotab is a Javascript application used to generate tablature for diatonic accordion / melodeon and harmonica.
It is based on a fork of abcjs which is maintained in a separate [repository](https://github.com/RickvanderS/abcjs-melodeon-tab).

The application can be used [here](https://diatotab.com) directly from the webbrowser.
